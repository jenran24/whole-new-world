        <img id="baby-scout" src="babyscout.JPG" alt="Scout as an adorable puppy next to his first toy">
        <main>Scout is a German Shepherd-mix who loves many things - 
        cardboard, whipped cream, chasing cats, backscratches, and walks. 
        His two-legged parents have had him for 4 years and are obsessed 
        with taking him on hikes and walks. 
        Yet, Scout is unique - his walks are never the same. 
        Here, we'll document Scout's unique walking habits.</main>
