    <h2>Who is Scout?</h2>
    <main>Scout is a German Shepherd-mix who loves many things - cardboard, whipped cream, chasing cats, backscratches, and walks. His two-legged parents have had him for 4 years and are obsessed with taking him on hikes and walks. Yet, Scout is unique - his walks are never the same. Here, we'll document Scout's unique walking habits.</main>
